            5. Js program to convert Byte to String.<br>
            byte := []   byte{72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 87, 111, 114, 108, 100}
        </h4>

        <h4>7. Js program to find Last Character in a String.</h4>
        <h4>8. Js program to find middle Character in a String 
            testcase: If the string have no perfect middle, then throw a meaningful error message.</h4>
        <h4>9.  Js program to print String Characters.</h4>
        <h4>10. Js program to print String Length with and without len() function.</h4>
        <h4>11. Js program to print the index of specified character in a string.</h4>
        <h4>12. Js program to check the occurence of a given character in a string.</h4>
        <h4>13. Js program to check the specified substring is the prefix of the given string.</h4>
        <h4>14. Js program to replace a string with another string.</h4>
        <h4>15. Js program to reverse the case (if the given string is in lowercase, then change it to uppercase and viceversa).</h4>
        <h4>16. Js program to reverse all the vowels present in a given string. Return the new string.</h4>
        <h4>17. Js program to count alphabets, digits or a special symbol in an input string.</h4>
        <h4>18. Js program to count vowels and consonants in an input string.</h4>
        <!-- <h4>19. Js program to check the given string with chars (){}[], are closed correctly. E.g () is valid, but )( is not valid. ({}) Is valid, but (}{) is not valid. (({{[]}})) Is valid. </h4> -->
        <h4>20. Js program to find the largest and smallest word in a string.</h4>
        <h4>21. Js program to change every letter in a given string with the letter following it in the alphabet (ie. a becomes b, p becomes q, z becomes a). </h4>
        <h4>22. Js program to identify the missing letter in a given string (list of alphabets). The method returns, "There is no missing letter!" if no letters are missing from the string.<br>
            **Example:**<br>
            Original string: abcdef<br>
            Identify the missing letter in the said string:<br>
            There is no missing letter!<br>
        </h4>
        <h4>23. Js program to delete all consonants from the string "Hello, have a good day".</h4>
        <!-- <h4>24. Js program to find out the number of occurrence of all alphabets in that string. Find out the alphabet with maximum occurrence.</h4> -->
        <h4>25.  Input a string which contains some palindrome substrings. Js program to find out the position of palindrome substrings if exist and replace it by . (For example if input string is “bob has a radar plane” then it should convert in “*** has * ***** plane”.</h4>
